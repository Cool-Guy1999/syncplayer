# SyncPlayer

Here lies the source code of the [SyncPlayer](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.github.powerinside.syncplay) android app, starting from version 1.6.0.

Note: I open sourced this in a hurry and didn't get time to clean up. It may be messy and definitely contains some anti patterns here and there, including some cruft or stale code.
Pull requests welcome! Small or big.

Don't forget to do a `git submodule init && git submodule update` before building.
